# Password Manager
### PostgreSQL
This password manager uses the open source relational database system called PostgreSQL. This system is great for this project as it is free and open source however it does require some setup on the host computer for the database to function. All of their documentation can be found at this URL: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/. The system has primarily SQL support/usage for the bulk of the database interaction.
